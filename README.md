# scraper

Scrapes articles from eventhubs.com. Allows users to build/remove notes on each link.

Made from salvaged class code. Sorry it's ugly - I ran out of time.

I couldn't figure out how to scrape synchronously with the page refresh, so you might ahve to hit the button several times to get new posts to show.
